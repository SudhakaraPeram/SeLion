    JSON DataProvider is an implementation of SeLion DataProvider that operates on JSON files
  </p>
  <p>
    To find out more about the JSON file format please refer to <a href="http://www.json.org">Getting started with
    JSON</a>. JSON provides a convenient alternative to XML files. JSON is easy, for humans to read and write, also for
    machines to parse.
  </p>

  <h2>Simple Case</h2>
  <p>Let us look at a basic example to see how to use the SeLionDataProvider over JSON files.</p>
  <p>First create an JSON file similar to the following sample:</p>
  <pre data-src="../sample-files/jsonDataProviderSimple.json  " class="language-markup"></pre>
  <p>
    Lets say we want to pass an object of class <code>USER</code> to the <samp>Test</samp> method. For this,
    <code>USER</code> has to be a JavaBean. As an example we have the following for <code>USER</code> class.
    You will need to make corresponding JavaBeans for <code>AREA_CODE</code> and <code>BANK</code>.
  </p>
  <pre data-src="../sample-files/jsonDataProviderUserClass.java"></pre>
  <p>Note that each variables of the object has corresponding public getters and setters.</p>
  <p>A typical <samp>DataProvider</samp> method will be as follows:</p>
  <pre data-src="../sample-files/jsonDataProviderSimple.java"></pre>
  <p>
    We create a <code>SeLionDataProvider</code> using the <code>DataProviderFactory</code> by passing a type of 
    <code>DataResource</code>. Here we create an <code>InputStreamResource</code> using <em>path</em> to the JSON file,
    class of <code>USER</code> and the file type as <em>json</em>. We use the <code>DataResource</code> so created
    for the factory.
  </p>
  <p>Note that we need to pass the class of java object, in this case <code>USER</code> to the
    <code>InputStreamResource</code> to map the JSON entities to java objects. 
  </p>
  
  <p>A typical <samp>Test</samp> method using the <samp>DataProvider</samp> will be as follows:</p>
  <pre data-src="../sample-files/jsonDataProviderSimpleTest.java"></pre>

  <h2>Getting Specific Parts of the Data</h2>
  <p>We know how to retrieve entire data from the JSON file, and now let us focus on the ways of retrieving only
    specific data from the JSON file.</p>
  <p>
    We can retrieve specific rows from the JSON file by invoking respective methods on <samp>SeLionDataProvider</samp>.
  </p>
  <h4>By Indices</h4>
  <p>
    If you want to extract data with specific indices. It is possible by altering the <samp>DataProvider</samp> code.
  </p>
  <p>The code to form a <samp>DataProvider</samp> will look as follows:</p>
  <pre data-src="../sample-files/jsonDataProviderIndexes.java"></pre>
  <p>The above <samp>DataProvider</samp> will be the retrieve data on index 2.</p>
  <p>Note that <code>getDataByIndex</code> method also accepts a strings; for example, <em>"2, 4"</em> which will fetch
    data at the second and the fourth indices respectively.</p>
  <p>The <samp>Test</samp> method does not change.</p>
