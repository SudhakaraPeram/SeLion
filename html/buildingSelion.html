  <h1 class="page-header">Building SeLion from Source Code</h1>
      <!-- Docs page layout Starts-->
  <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
              <p>Make sure the following software is installed on your machine before trying to build SeLion:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">Java JDK 1.7</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">Maven 3.2.x</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/index.html">Chrome</a> (if you plan to run the build tests)</li>
                <li><a href="http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html">Chromedriver</a> (if you plan to run the build tests)</li>
              </ul>
  <h2>Cloning the Repository</h2>
      <p>To build SeLion you first need to clone the code from the git repository:</p>
  <pre data-src="../sample-files/gitCloneSelion.sh"></pre>
  <p>The entire Maven project will be cloned for you. The project is
    organized as a multi-module maven project. The folder will contain a POM file as
    well as separate folders for each of the sub modules. The good thing is
    that the sub modules
    can be run and built as independent Maven projects themselves.</p>
  <h2>Building the Jar</h2>
  <p>The build process kicks off all unit tests. If the tests run successfully, the artifacts get published to the local Maven repository (<code>~/.m2</code>).<p>
  <p>The below command will run the test cases against the Selenium grid that you have specified.</p>
  <pre data-src="../sample-files/runUnitTests.txt"></pre>
  <br>
  <p>The below command will spawn a Selenium Grid and all browsers on your local machine, for the tests to run.</p>
  <pre data-src="../sample-files/runLocallyCommand.txt"></pre>
  <p>Note: If you want to skip tests add <code>-DskipTests</code> to the line above. Also, for the
  "client" component, you can run a specific test suite with <code>-DsuiteXmlFile={a suite file in client/src/tests/resources/suites/}</code></p>

  <h2>Building Specific Maven Modules</h2>
  <p>Sometimes you might choose to only build/run tests for a single module. For example, the "client" module.
    To do this just switch to the folder of the corresponding module and use the above mentioned Maven commands.</p>
  <h2>Project Organization</h2>
  <p>All the Maven projects are organized as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>src/main/java</b> - Contains the code and logic of the application.</li>
    <li><b>src/test/java</b> - Contains the unit and functional tests used to check the application.</li>
    <li><b>src/main/resources</b> - Contains the non-code files required
      for the application to work.</li>
    <li><b>src/test/resources</b> - Contains all the files that are required to run the unit and functional tests. Also contains the suite
      files in addition to the data.</li>
  </ul>
